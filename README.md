A webDAV client library
=======================

This is the repository for a general webDAV client library, written in
JavaScript. The main purpose is to support the built-in client for *BeeHub*.
However, we attempt to make it follow the webDAV RFC 4918 and any contributions
that help implement features of this and other webDAV standards are welkcome.
